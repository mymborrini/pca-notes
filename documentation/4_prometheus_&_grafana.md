# Prometheus & Grafana

There are two methodologies to create meaningful dashboards:

 - RED (Request Errors Duration)
 - USE (Utilization Saturation Errors)


Creating a dashboard that combines both methodology we provide a dashboard that monitor both user experience and system performance

Is a good idea to first create a query in prometheus using promql and then moving to the grafana dashboard.
